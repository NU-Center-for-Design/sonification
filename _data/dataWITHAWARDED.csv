We used the Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Electrical Skin Activity (EDA), and Heart Rate (HR) to represent a user’s temporal stress level changes. The sounds of rain, thunder, and bird song, which are commonly found in the rainy-day soundscape, were chosen to represent variations in the three physiological measures."

This example has been tailor made to a particular group, the paradise jumping spiders (genus Habronattus), but it is driven by a generative music system that may be adapted for any other tree of life — any group of species, or phylogenetic dataset. It is built in Max/MSP, plus a python script that converts Annotated Newick phylogenetic data into JSON, and released under a GNU-GPLv3 license.

Accompanying this sonification is a 2-part podcast, 96 minutes in total, featuring original music and sound design. Part 1 illustrates evolutionary dynamics as a metaphorical song and dance, exemplified in detail by jumping spiders: an astonishingly diverse group of spiders who literally sing and dance. Part 2 unpacks the practice of data sonification, introduces the newly released sonification system with its musical output, and discusses the role of beauty in science.

Myozin III is responsible for development of stereocilia – the hairs of the hearing cells in our cochlea. Mutations in the myosin-III coding gene cause the protein to mis-develop and lead to hereditary hearing loss. 

Following the two protein sequences parallelly – the healthy (L channel) and the mutated (R channel) – we encounter a sonic shift with every amino acid misalignment. Each sonic event (a note) represents an amino acid. The scale was derived from respectable molecular masses and duration of every event from hidrophobicity index.  As the piece progresses and the mutation count rises, the correlated sequences get more and more misaligned, leading to an increasingly degraded sense of pitch, rhythm, and amplitude.

It's a comparative sonic analysis aimed to portray how even miniscule genetic misalignments result in a radical cascading change of perceptive and functional meaning in the genetic code - amino acid sequence."

So, with every click or tap, we send some data.🤳

But almost every click sends our data to dozens of other URLs. Some are necessary to give you what you want. But others, like third-party requests, use your data for advertising and business. In that way, we create an unintentional echo in the virtual world.

463,Seasons,Seasons,Mia Forrest,2023,Life Sciences,Biology,Art,General Public,,Artifact,,Acoustic Sonification,,,,https://www.mia-forrest.com/seasons,Seasons,,,,,,,,,"Using sensors to measure the fluctuations in electrical conductivity from botanical specimens, yields audible rhythmic and melodic information when processed through a digital audio workstation. The biodata is then amplified through a low-frequency vibration generator beneath paper, imbuing fine raw pigments into a state of perceived automatism upon the paper. The emergent patterns are governed by a naturally occurring phenomenon known as cymatics - the occurrence of sound made visible - where nodal and antinodal patterns are shaped by resonance and vibration. The autonomous mark making of pigments and crossover patterns reveal an abstract impressionistic landscape; a nod to the source itself. In processing the sonification inherent in botanicals, and using that biodata to autonomously “paint” resonant patterns, we can view this work as a generative instance. Furthermore, the “randomness” of the rhythmic pattern that resonates onto the paper, is determined by the health and chemistry of the plant, as well as the environmental factors (temperature, time of day): these parameters allow the form to emerge. Nature IS the algorithm. To set the image, for hours my kabuki brush swirls the emergent patterns of pigment into the paper, rendering a gaussian blur as each colour graduates into the other. I enjoy the physicality and meditative surrender as I trace the made marks into lush gradients with my brush, with full trust in the guidance from its source. I view the work as an intimate collaboration between nature, its hidden intrinsic energetic code, and myself. The work is a testament to my ongoing dedication to ""nature as muse""."

The detected vibrations are caused by tiny, random thermal fluctuations and  the quantum Heisenberg uncertainty principle. In the sonification, you can hear the vibrating (ringing) drum suddenly changing in frequency and getting louder. This 'switching' event was caused by a short-lived warm-up of the resonator by a few thousandths of a Kelvin. By 'listening' instead of looking as we usually do at scientific data, we can sometimes discover short-lived signals, like this switching event.     

The sonified drum tone was chosen to closely match that of a beehive recording made on an early autumn day, 2020.

410,Broadcast,Broadcast,Studio Tilt,2021,Mobility,Urban Studies,Research,General Public,,Sound,,Parameter Mapping,,,,https://www.studiotilt.design/broadcast,Broadcast,,,,,,,,,"Broadcast is particularly focused on what we call ‘Imaginary Leaps’— the conceptualization of places and spaces that data venture to on their journey to and from the home. We argue that more abundant, playful, and imaginary encounters with home data might offer a site for reclaiming data for home dwellers. Broadcast uses sound as an analogy to interpret and imagine data’s travel. Specifically, the sounds focus on two aspects of data: how they travel, and where they go. Broadcast provokes people to imagine data’s volume, speed, intensity, and destinations.

Broadcast is one of the three artifacts in the Odd Intepreters family. View project details for Soft Fading and Data Bakery.
Broadcast tunes into Alexa’s data traffic activity in and out of the home, and interprets the data’s travel into imaginative sounds. 
Broadcast is comprised of a raspberry pi microcontroller, a small speaker, and a rotary encoder attached to the blue resin sphere. Early on in the process, we were drawn towards the idea of a dial so that people could ‘tune into’ data. When we originally proposed this concept, we had imagined that data were sent and received only when interacting with Alexa via voice. We were under the impression that Alexa is only active once her wake word is spoken. However, to our surprise, Broadcast showed that the Amazon Echo device is constantly sending and receiving data: it is checking if it is still online, if there are new updates, etc.We worked with a sound designer, Trevor White, to create 14 soundclips that could represent the modes in which data travel in and out of the home. These sounds are inspired by physical places data travel (e.g. data centers) and how data travel (e.g. while in tubes or underwater).

These two categories of data’s journies, Data in Transit and Data at a Location, comprise Broadcast’s sound design. The ephemerality of Broadcast’s sound design and interaction is important to demonstrate how data are always moving, they are not in the home, but rather part of large meshes of mobile data.Publications

We are interested in the shape of the active cases curve, informing on the pandemic situation of a given country. A bell shaped curve indicates a well controlled situation whereas some countries are only at the beginning of it.

The sounds generated from the active cases have a pitch and pulse depending on the total number of cases. The amplitude follows the active cases curve to give an indication of its shape with a panning suggesting a timeline. The bassline indicates the beginning of a reading and illustrates the relative number of deaths related to total cases

The accuracy of this dataset in respect to real situations is subject to available information and governmental policies. Every single country has its own way to identifying occurred Covid-19 cases and causes of death in their population.

The project also aims to provide the educational tools (maps and interactive audio-visual content) that will be developed for a remote understanding of the Geoparks for schools, teachers, and students as well as easier navigation for people with disabilities in real visits. Our main task in this project is to develop two applications and one interactive website related to Geology and Geoparks for the visually impaired and the disabled, as well as the general public. The first application will transform images and geological evidence such as fossils, rocks or petrified trees into sound. When this happens a visually impaired person can touch a touchscreen and “feel” according to the sound changes the shape of the fossil or geological evidence. The second application refers to a mapping and navigation application with special features for the disabled and the visually impaired. With this mapping application, a visitor in a Geopark can be assisted in their path, especially one with a disability. This route can then be available to other visitors either they visit the Geopark, or through the interactive website."

Data are available at www.nationalgrid.com. Using VBA I converted half-hourly data for January 2013 into beeps with frequency determined by the size of the demand. I used Audacity to record the output, then played around with pitch and speed and added some reverb.

Sonification is the representation of data through sound. It can be a useful addition to visual display. In this video, for example, I think the high demand on the grid during the cold patch in the middle of January is conveyed more strikingly than it would be by a graph. You also get a real sense of the rhythm of the nation's electricity demand. "
