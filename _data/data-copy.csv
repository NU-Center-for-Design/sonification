The project also aims to provide the educational tools (maps and interactive audio-visual content) that will be developed for a remote understanding of the Geoparks for schools, teachers, and students as well as easier navigation for people with disabilities in real visits. Our main task in this project is to develop two applications and one interactive website related to Geology and Geoparks for the visually impaired and the disabled, as well as the general public. The first application will transform images and geological evidence such as fossils, rocks or petrified trees into sound. When this happens a visually impaired person can touch a touchscreen and “feel” according to the sound changes the shape of the fossil or geological evidence. The second application refers to a mapping and navigation application with special features for the disabled and the visually impaired. With this mapping application, a visitor in a Geopark can be assisted in their path, especially one with a disability. This route can then be available to other visitors either they visit the Geopark, or through the interactive website."

Therefore, we recorded more than 30 samples of speeches from all parties and both genders. For the sound, we distributed the samples according to the proportion of speeches - men in the left headphone, women in the right."

The detected vibrations are caused by tiny, random thermal fluctuations and  the quantum Heisenberg uncertainty principle. In the sonification, you can hear the vibrating (ringing) drum suddenly changing in frequency and getting louder. This 'switching' event was caused by a short-lived warm-up of the resonator by a few thousandths of a Kelvin. By 'listening' instead of looking as we usually do at scientific data, we can sometimes discover short-lived signals, like this switching event.     

The sonified drum tone was chosen to closely match that of a beehive recording made on an early autumn day, 2020.

,Broadcast,Broadcast,Studio Tilt,2021,Mobility,,,Research,,General Public,,Sound,,Parameter Mapping,,,https://www.studiotilt.design/broadcast,Broadcast,,,,,,,,,"Broadcast is particularly focused on what we call ‘Imaginary Leaps’— the conceptualization of places and spaces that data venture to on their journey to and from the home. We argue that more abundant, playful, and imaginary encounters with home data might offer a site for reclaiming data for home dwellers. Broadcast uses sound as an analogy to interpret and imagine data’s travel. Specifically, the sounds focus on two aspects of data: how they travel, and where they go. Broadcast provokes people to imagine data’s volume, speed, intensity, and destinations.

Broadcast is one of the three artifacts in the Odd Intepreters family. View project details for Soft Fading and Data Bakery.
Broadcast tunes into Alexa’s data traffic activity in and out of the home, and interprets the data’s travel into imaginative sounds. 
Broadcast is comprised of a raspberry pi microcontroller, a small speaker, and a rotary encoder attached to the blue resin sphere. Early on in the process, we were drawn towards the idea of a dial so that people could ‘tune into’ data. When we originally proposed this concept, we had imagined that data were sent and received only when interacting with Alexa via voice. We were under the impression that Alexa is only active once her wake word is spoken. However, to our surprise, Broadcast showed that the Amazon Echo device is constantly sending and receiving data: it is checking if it is still online, if there are new updates, etc.We worked with a sound designer, Trevor White, to create 14 soundclips that could represent the modes in which data travel in and out of the home. These sounds are inspired by physical places data travel (e.g. data centers) and how data travel (e.g. while in tubes or underwater).

These two categories of data’s journies, Data in Transit and Data at a Location, comprise Broadcast’s sound design. The ephemerality of Broadcast’s sound design and interaction is important to demonstrate how data are always moving, they are not in the home, but rather part of large meshes of mobile data.Publications

In the temporal development of the audiovisual flow, each second of the piece corresponds to a day, from January 1, 2020, to March 18, 2022, which marked the first celebration of the national day established in memory of the pandemic victims. The number of sound and visual events per second equals the number of deaths that day.

This example has been tailor made to a particular group, the paradise jumping spiders (genus Habronattus), but it is driven by a generative music system that may be adapted for any other tree of life — any group of species, or phylogenetic dataset. It is built in Max/MSP, plus a python script that converts Annotated Newick phylogenetic data into JSON, and released under a GNU-GPLv3 license.

Accompanying this sonification is a 2-part podcast, 96 minutes in total, featuring original music and sound design. Part 1 illustrates evolutionary dynamics as a metaphorical song and dance, exemplified in detail by jumping spiders: an astonishingly diverse group of spiders who literally sing and dance. Part 2 unpacks the practice of data sonification, introduces the newly released sonification system with its musical output, and discusses the role of beauty in science.
